# Economic Overview

RebusÂ´s economic system is designed to foster a self-sustaining economy where incentives are aligned to drive security and decentralization of the Rebus Network.

Participants in this economy include validators,delegators and thirdy party projects.

The native network incentive structures is pre-set in the Rebus protocol at genesis. 
The onchain governance can be used by Rebus delegators and validators to vote on the Community and Ethical proposal.  
Incentives follow a pre-set model that has been crafted to strongly incentivize early adopters and gradually decreases as fees generated by p2p transactions and usage of decentralized applications on Rebus make up for the decrease over time. 
These protocol-based rewards are distributed across the active validators/delegators, and different fund pools: community, ethical, treasury, incentive.
More structural details can be found in our [token economic page,](https://www.rebuschain.com/platform/token-economics), and in the [block reward schedule](rebus/economic-overview/block-reward-schedule.md)
