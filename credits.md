## Documentation Credits

We've started the documentation from the [Juno documetation repository](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/docs) as a reference of what we needed in our documetation as the two projects have some similaries. 

All the icons that are not part of the [Octicon icons set](https://primer.github.io/octicons/) have been taken from [ICONS8](https://icons8.com/).

The documentation is deployed on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [Retype](https://retype.com).
