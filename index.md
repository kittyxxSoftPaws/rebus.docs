# Introduction


## **What is Rebus?**

Rebus is a platform built to host blockchain applications (EVM) and native Vaults usable across multiple sovereign networks.

### **Why Rebus?**

Rebus as a **sovereign public blockchain** in the Cosmos ecosystem, aims to provide an environment for the deployment of interoperable smart contracts. The network serves as a **decentralized, permissionless & censorship resistant** avenue for developers to efficiently and securely launch smart contracts using standard framworks. 


### **Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) and Interchain Account (ICA)**

At the heart of Cosmos ecosystem is the Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) and then the Interchain Account (ICA), which sets the table for an interoperable base layer 0 to now be used to transfer data packets across thousands of independent networks supporting IBC/ICA. This enables Rebus smart contracts and Rebus Vaults to interoperate with all IBC enabled networks.

### **Cosmos SDK**

The Rebus blockchain is built using the **Cosmos SDK framework**. A generalized framework that simplifies the process of building secure blockchain applications on top of Tendermint BFT. It is based on two major principles: Modularity & capabilities-based security.

### **Tendermint**

Agreement on the network is reached via **Tendermint BFT consensus**.

Tendermint BFT is a solution that packages the networking and consensus layers of a blockchain into a generic engine, allowing developers to focus on application development as opposed to the complex underlying protocol. As a result, Tendermint saves hundreds of hours of development time.

### **EVM**

Rebus is built on top of Ethermint and bring with it the EVM/Ethereum compatibility.
