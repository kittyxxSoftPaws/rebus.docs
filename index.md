# Introduction

## **Origin Story**

Rebus originates & evolves from a **community driven initiative**, prompted by dozens of developers, validators & delegators in the Cosmos ecosystem. The shared vision is to **preserve the neutrality, performance & reliability** of the Cosmos Hub and offload smart contract deployment to a dedicated sister Hub.

Some of the founding principles centre around:

⚪️ Inception of the **worlds first permission-less, designated interoperable smart contract network.**

⚪️ Pioneering **CosmWasm development** **and adoption**.

⚪️ Eliminating common smart contract **L1 bottlenecks** (poor scalability, non-interoperability, high fees, concentrated governance control).

⚪️ **Sister Hub to the Cosmos Hub** - Preserving the neutrality of the Hub by offloading smart contract usage/congestion to a designated contract zone.

⚪️ **Governance by ATOM stakers which become REBUS stakers**. Stakedrop where 47% of the genesis supply goes to ATOM stakers on a 1:1 basis.

⚪️ **Eliminating potential legal limitations** (Rebus has not/will not conduct any form of seed sale, private sale or public sale. All $REBUS entered circulation via the decentralized network launch on October 1st 2021)

## **What is Rebus?**

Rebus is an open source platform for **interoperable smart contracts** which automatically executes, controls or documents a procedure of relevant events and actions according to the terms of such contract or agreement to be valid & usable across multiple sovereign networks.

### **Why Rebus?**

Rebus as a **sovereign public blockchain** in the Cosmos ecosystem, aims to provide an environment for the deployment of interoperable smart contracts. The network serves as a **decentralized, permissionless & censorship resistant** avenue for developers to efficiently and securely launch smart contracts using proven frameworks and compile them in various languages **Rust & Go.**

Battle tested contract modules such as **CosmWasm**, allow for **decentralized applications** (dapps) to be compiled on robust and secure multi-chain smart contracts. Additional specialized modules may be introduced at any time via on-chain governance.

### **Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC)**

At the heart of Cosmos ecosystem is the Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), which sets the table for an interoperable base layer 0 to now be used to transfer data packets across thousands of independent networks supporting IBC. Naturally, the next evolutionary milestone is to enable cross-network smart contracts. This enables Rebus smart contracts to interoperate with all IBC enabled networks.

### **Cosmos SDK**

The Rebus blockchain is built using the **Cosmos SDK framework**. A generalized framework that simplifies the process of building secure blockchain applications on top of Tendermint BFT. It is based on two major principles: Modularity & capabilities-based security.

### **Tendermint**

Agreement on the network is reached via **Tendermint BFT consensus**.

Tendermint BFT is a solution that packages the networking and consensus layers of a blockchain into a generic engine, allowing developers to focus on application development as opposed to the complex underlying protocol. As a result, Tendermint saves hundreds of hours of development time.

### **CosmWasm**

Rebus is the neutral [home of CosmWasm](rebus/home-of-cosmwasm.md) smart contracts and the InterWasm DAO. The Rebus Network ecosystem is pioneering CosmWasm development and adoption.
