# Help with wallet set ups

This section is to help users that might have issues setting up their wallet to connect to the Rebus chain.

## WAX users (also users not seeing their balance on Keplr)

WAX users had initially set up their Keplr wallet using the WAX airdrop page. That was a temporary page to get the rebus mainnet address. In order to receive your token you need to follow the steps below

### Remove Rebus chain from Keplr

Go to your Keplr wallet and select a different blockchain.
Then in the blockchain dropdown go to the Rebus chain and click on the `x` to the right of the name

Click `Yes` on the prompt
![](<../../public/assets/reset-rebus-2.png>)

After that click on the connect wallet button and approve the experimental features:

At this point you should be all set with the latest version of the Rebus chain. Select the Rebus chain and verify your amount. If you are a WAX users you should also see one LUDUS Token assigned to your wallet.

If after following the steps above you still have issues please fill out the form [here](https://forms.gle/h2nvK8H2K3WKGXkV9).

## Which wallet should I use

If you are an ATOM, OSMOS or WAX user select the first wallet Keplr Wallet or if you were using Cosmostation for staking select that one. 

If you are an EVMOS Keplr user select the second button Keplr Wallet (EVMOS)

If you are a Evmos Metamask user please select the third Metamask button.
